The dynamic-graph shell program "dg-shell" allows access to the dynamic-graph library's
Interpreter class, which can execute commands and scripts from the command line.
It can be found in the installation prefix's bin/ directory.

There is also a linux shell script available, dg-shell-plugin, that creates a

For an example of shell commands and scripts, see \ref scriptingabout.
