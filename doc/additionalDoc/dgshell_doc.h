/**
\page dgshell_doc dg-shell executable
Dynamic-graph shell program "dg-shell" allows access to the dynamic-graph library's
Interpreter class, which can execute commands and scripts from the command line.
It can be found in the installlation prefix's bin/ directory.

There is also a linux shell script available, dg-shell-plugin, that runs
dg-shell with a default script, which in turns loads useful plugins as
shell-functions and shell-procedure.
