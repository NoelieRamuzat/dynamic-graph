  \brief This class keep tracks of all the objects in the stack of Tasks.

  This class gives access to and remembers all the entities created
  during its life.

  This class provides the necessary operations to register, unregister each
  instance of thoses classes.
  As tasks and features derived from Entities, they should be registered
  as such.

  \note From the code it is not very clear why we should not unregister
  from the tasks and the features...

  The role of this class is also to look for the object supporting
  a command, and to apply this command.

  It also returns signal.
